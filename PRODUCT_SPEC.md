## 1. Executive Summary

### What is Wayfinder Router?

Wayfinder Router is a **lightweight, high-performance proxy server** that provides a trusted single-domain entry point to the decentralized ar.io gateway network. It enables organizations to access Arweave permanent storage through a single trusted domain while leveraging the resilience and distribution of the entire ar.io network.

### The Problem

Organizations accessing Arweave data face a trust dilemma:

- **Single gateway dependency**: Trusting one gateway creates a single point of failure and requires trusting that operator
- **Direct network access**: Accessing multiple gateways directly requires trusting each one individually
- **Verification complexity**: Implementing data verification client-side is complex and resource-intensive
- **Domain management**: Managing multiple gateway domains complicates security policies, CORS, and user experience

### The Solution

Wayfinder Router solves this by:

1. **Single trusted domain**: Users trust only `your-router.com`, not individual gateways
2. **Network-backed resilience**: Routes requests across the entire ar.io network
3. **Cryptographic verification**: Verifies all data before serving to users
4. **Transparent operation**: Functions as a drop-in replacement for direct gateway access

### Key Metrics

| Metric | Target |
|--------|--------|
| Request latency (p50) | < 100ms overhead |
| Request latency (p99) | < 500ms overhead |
| Availability | 99.9% uptime |
| Verification accuracy | 100% (cryptographic) |
| Gateway failover time | < 1 second |

## 2. Product Vision

### Mission Statement

> Enable any organization to access the permanent web through a single trusted endpoint, backed by the resilience of a decentralized network, without sacrificing security or performance.

### Vision

Wayfinder Router becomes the standard way enterprises and institutions access Arweave data—providing the simplicity of a single API endpoint with the security guarantees of cryptographic verification and the resilience of a decentralized network.

### Strategic Goals

1. **Trust Minimization**: Reduce the trust surface from "trust every gateway" to "trust one domain + cryptography"
2. **Enterprise Adoption**: Enable regulated industries to access permanent storage with audit trails
3. **Developer Experience**: Provide a simple, familiar HTTP interface that "just works"
4. **Network Health**: Distribute load across the ar.io network, improving overall ecosystem resilience

---

## 3. Core Principles

### 3.1 Security First

Every design decision prioritizes security:

- **Zero trust for gateways**: All gateway responses are cryptographically verified
- **Consensus-based resolution**: ArNS names require multiple gateways to agree
- **No data leakage**: Internal gateway headers are stripped from responses
- **Fail secure**: When in doubt, reject rather than serve potentially bad data

### 3.2 Resilience by Design

The router must be more reliable than any single gateway:

- **Automatic failover**: Failed gateways are bypassed transparently
- **Circuit breakers**: Repeated failures trigger temporary blacklisting
- **Graceful degradation**: Partial failures don't cause total outages
- **Self-healing**: Recovered gateways are automatically re-enabled

### 3.3 Performance Without Compromise

Security and resilience cannot come at the cost of unusable performance:

- **Streaming verification**: Data flows to users while being verified
- **Intelligent routing**: Fastest available gateway is selected
- **Minimal overhead**: Proxy adds < 100ms latency in typical cases
- **Efficient caching**: Reduce redundant verification work

### 3.4 Operational Simplicity

The router should be easy to deploy and maintain:

- **Single binary/container**: No complex dependencies
- **Environment-based configuration**: 12-factor app compliance
- **Observable by default**: Metrics, logs, and health checks built-in
- **Horizontal scalability**: Stateless design enables easy scaling

### 3.5 Transparency

Users should understand exactly what the router does:

- **Clear documentation**: Every feature and behavior documented
- **Audit headers**: Response headers indicate verification status
- **Open source**: Full source code available for inspection
- **No hidden behavior**: What you configure is what you get

### 11.2 Threat Model

#### 11.2.1 Threats Mitigated

| Threat | Mitigation |
|--------|------------|
| **Malicious gateway serving wrong content** | Hash verification against trusted gateways |
| **Single gateway compromise** | Consensus-based ArNS resolution |
| **Man-in-the-middle attack** | TLS for all gateway communication |
| **Gateway returning stale ArNS** | TTL-based cache expiration |
| **Denial of service via gateway** | Circuit breaker, automatic failover |
| **Information leakage via headers** | Strip internal gateway headers |
| **SSRF attacks** | Validate gateway URLs, no user-controlled hosts |

#### 11.2.2 Threats NOT Mitigated

| Threat | Reason | Recommendation |
|--------|--------|----------------|
| **Compromise of all trusted gateways** | No remaining source of truth | Use independent trusted gateways |
| **Router infrastructure compromise** | Out of scope | Standard infra security practices |
| **DDoS against router** | Requires external mitigation | Use CDN/WAF |
| **Private data exposure** | Arweave is public | Don't store private data |

### 11.3 Security Controls

#### 11.3.1 Input Validation

- Transaction IDs: Must match `/^[A-Za-z0-9_-]{43}$/`
- ArNS names: Must match `/^[a-z0-9_-]{1,51}$/i`
- Paths: Sanitized, no directory traversal
- Query parameters: Whitelist allowed parameters

#### 11.3.2 Output Sanitization

- Error messages: No internal details exposed
- Headers: Internal gateway headers stripped
- Logs: No sensitive request content logged

#### 11.3.3 Cryptographic Operations

- Hash algorithm: SHA-256
- Encoding: Base64url (URL-safe)
- Verification: Compare computed vs trusted hash

#### 11.3.4 Content Moderation Security

When content moderation is enabled:

- **Admin Token Authentication**: All moderation API requests require `Authorization: Bearer {token}` header
- **Token Requirements**: Admin token should be minimum 16 characters, randomly generated
- **Audit Trail**: All block/unblock actions are logged with timestamp and actor
- **Immediate Effect**: Blocked content is purged from all caches immediately
- **File Permissions**: Blocklist file should have restricted permissions (600)
- **Hot Reload Security**: File watcher only triggers on valid JSON content

**Threats Specific to Moderation:**

| Threat | Mitigation |
|--------|------------|
| Unauthorized blocklist modification | Admin token required for all mutations |
| Token exposure in logs | Tokens are not logged |
| Blocklist file tampering | File integrity monitored, atomic writes |
| Blocking via brute force | Rate limiting on admin endpoints |

#### 11.3.5 Arweave API Proxy Security

When Arweave HTTP API proxy is enabled:

- **No User-Controlled Hosts**: Only configured Arweave nodes are contacted
- **Request Validation**: API paths are validated against known endpoint patterns
- **No Write Operations Without Config**: Write nodes must be explicitly configured
- **Response Sanitization**: Node responses are not modified, but unexpected formats are rejected
- **Timeout Protection**: All node requests have configurable timeouts

**Threats Specific to Arweave API:**

| Threat | Mitigation |
|--------|------------|
| SSRF via malformed requests | Strict path validation, no host override |
| Stale blockchain data | Configurable cache TTLs with short dynamic TTL |
| Node exhaustion | Round-robin selection, retry on different nodes |
| Large response attacks | Response size limits |

#### 11.3.6 GraphQL Proxy Security

When GraphQL proxy is enabled:

- **Fixed Upstream**: Only the configured `GRAPHQL_PROXY_URL` is contacted
- **No Query Modification**: Queries are passed through without modification
- **Upstream Indicator**: Response headers indicate the upstream used
- **Method Restriction**: Only GET and POST methods are proxied

### 11.4 Security Checklist

**Core Security:**
- [ ] All gateway communication uses HTTPS
- [ ] Trusted gateways are independently operated
- [ ] Consensus threshold ≥ 2 for ArNS resolution
- [ ] Rate limiting enabled to prevent abuse
- [ ] Router deployed behind TLS-terminating load balancer

**Logging & Monitoring:**
- [ ] Logs do not contain sensitive data (tokens, PII)
- [ ] Error messages are generic (no internal details)
- [ ] Monitoring for anomalous traffic patterns
- [ ] Regular security audits of dependencies

**Content Moderation (if enabled):**
- [ ] Admin token is randomly generated and ≥ 16 characters
- [ ] Admin token is stored securely (not in source control)
- [ ] Blocklist file has restricted permissions (600)
- [ ] Moderation actions are audited

**Arweave API Proxy (if enabled):**
- [ ] Only trusted Arweave nodes are configured
- [ ] Appropriate cache TTLs for dynamic vs immutable data
- [ ] Request timeouts are configured

**GraphQL Proxy (if enabled):**
- [ ] GraphQL upstream is a trusted endpoint
- [ ] Response size limits are appropriate

### 12.2 Infrastructure Requirements

#### 12.2.1 DNS Configuration

```
# A records for base domain
router.example.com.     A     <load-balancer-ip>

# Wildcard for ArNS subdomains
*.router.example.com.   A     <load-balancer-ip>
```

#### 12.2.2 TLS Certificates

- **Requirement:** Wildcard certificate for `*.router.example.com`
- **Options:**
  - Let's Encrypt with DNS-01 challenge
  - Commercial wildcard certificate
  - Self-managed PKI (for internal deployments)

#### 12.2.3 Load Balancer

- TLS termination at load balancer
- Health check: `GET /wayfinder/health`
- Sticky sessions: Not required (stateless)
- Timeout: 120 seconds (for large file transfers)

### 12.3 Scaling Guidelines

| Traffic Level | Instances | CPU per Instance | Memory per Instance |
|---------------|-----------|------------------|---------------------|
| < 100 req/s | 1-2 | 0.5 vCPU | 256MB |
| 100-500 req/s | 2-4 | 1 vCPU | 512MB |
| 500-2000 req/s | 4-8 | 2 vCPU | 1GB |
| > 2000 req/s | 8+ | 2 vCPU | 1GB |

**Auto-scaling Triggers:**
- CPU > 70% for 2 minutes → scale up
- CPU < 30% for 10 minutes → scale down
- Request queue depth > 100 → scale up
